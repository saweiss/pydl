PURPOSE
-------
PyDL repackages certain Python functions in a way that is friendly to
those who are used to the Interactive Data Language (IDL).

Not all IDL functions will be recreated with PyDL. If the existing
Python way of accomplishing something is close enough to IDL or easier
in Python, then that feature will not be repackaged.

The author(s) of this package have no affiliations to IDL or Harris
Geospatial Solutions. Please use this package at your own discretion.
